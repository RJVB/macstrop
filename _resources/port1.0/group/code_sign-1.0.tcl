# Usage:
# PortGroup     code_sign 1.0

# checks for the existence of a file etc/macports/codesigning.conf and read options
# from that file if it exists. If that provides a non-empty option `identity`, its
# contents will be used to sign the file given in the first argument. If the file also
# defines the `user` option, the signing operation will be run as that user. This is
# required unless the MacPorts user has the desired signing key in the keychain, or when
# using the ad hoc identify ("-").
# Additional arguments allow to override the defaults from codesigning.conf, e.g.
#
# codesign ${sub_prefix}/bin/debugserver lldb_codesign
#
# This procedure is supposed to be called from the post-activate phase. The procedure
# returns 0 in case of success, and 1 otherwise. This makes it possible to instruct
# the user, for instance to create the required key.
# Note that care should be taken (in a post-activate block) that the activation procedure
# doesn't abort.
