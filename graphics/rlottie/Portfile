description     platform independent standalone c++ library for rendering vector based animations and art in realtime.
long_description rlottie is a platform independent standalone c++ library for rendering vector based animations and \
                art in realtime. Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON format. \
                Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from several applications. For the first time, designers can \
                create and ship beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand. \
                Since the animation is backed by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity!
