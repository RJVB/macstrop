+This option causes rsync to preserve HFS+

+does not support it, rsync will exit with an error.
+.IP 
+Filesystem compression was introduced to HFS+ in Mac OS 10.6. A file that is
+compressed has no data in its data fork. Rather, the compressed data is stored
+in an extended attribute named com.apple.decmpfs and a file flag is set to
+indicate that the file is compressed (UF_COMPRESSED). HFS+ decompresses this
+data \(dq\&on\-the\-fly\(dq\& and presents it to the operating system as a normal file.
+Normal attempts to copy compressed files (e.g. in the Finder, via cp, ditto,
+etc.) will copy the file\(cq\&s decompressed contents, remove the UF_COMPRESSED file
+flag, and discard the com.apple.decmpfs extended attribute. This option will
+preserve the data in the com.apple.decmpfs extended attribute and ignore the
+synthesized data in the file contents.

+.IP 
+.IP "\fB\-\-protect\-decmpfs\fP"
+The com.apple.decmpfs extended attribute is hidden
+by default from list/get xattr calls, therefore normal attempts to copy
+compressed files will functionally decompress those files. While this is
+desirable behavior when copying files to filesystems that do not support HFS+
+compression, it has serious performance and capacity impacts when backing up
+or restoring the Mac OS X filesystem.
+.IP 
+This option will transfer the com.apple.decmpfs extended attribute regardless
+of support on the destination. If a source file is compressed and an existing
+file on the destination is not compressed, the data fork of the destination
+file will be truncated and the com.apple.decmpfs xattr will be transferred
+instead. Note that compressed files will not be readable to the operating
+system of the destination if that operating system does not support HFS+
+compression. Once restored (with or without this option) to an operating system
