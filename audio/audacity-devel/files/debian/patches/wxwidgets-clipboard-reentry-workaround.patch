Description: Workaround for wxWidgets bug: Reentry in clipboard
 The wxWidgets bug http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/16636 prevents
 us from doing clipboard operations in wxShowEvent and wxTimerEvent
 processing because those event could possibly be processed during
 the (not sufficiently protected) Yield() of a first clipboard
 operation, causing reentry. Audacity had a workaround in place
 for this problem (the class "CaptureEvents"), which however isn't
 applicable with wxWidgets 3.0 because it's based on changing the
 gdk event handler, a change that would be overridden by wxWidgets's
 own gdk event handler change.
 Instead, as a new workaround, specifically protect those processings
 of wxShowEvent and wxTimerEvent that try to do clipboard operations
 from being executed within Yield(). This is done by delaying their
 execution by posting pure wxWidgets events - which are never executed
 during Yield().
